The **Decode Text** action allows you to decode text from various different formats into standard readable text. Decoding is required when a service (such as an external API) provides an encoded form of text that you need to decode and use in your endpoint.

### Input Text

The **input text** is the base text value that will be decoded. This may be static text or a variable.

### Encoding Method

The **encoding method** is the format of encoding that your text value is in. Below are listed the available formats that a text value can be decoded from using the Decode Text action:

| **Format** | **Description**                                                                     | **Example Output**                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base64     | Helps prevent data corruption in JSON, HTTP Headers, etc.                           | `SGVsbG8gVGhlcmU=`                                                                                   |
| Base64URL  | URL-safe version of Base64 that prevents corruption in URLs, query parameters, etc. | `SGVsbG8gVGhlcmU`                                                                                    |
| Hex        | Converts to hexadecimal with a base-16 format for compacting and safety             | `48656c6c6f205468657265`                                                                             |
| UTF-8      | Efficient endocing format used for web services and multilingual compatibility      | `Hello There`                                                                                        |
| ASCII      | Standard binary integer used to represent English characters                        | `Hello There`                                                                                        |
| Binary     | Foundational 2-bit encoding format used at the deepest levels of computing          | `01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100000 01010100 01101000 01100101 01110010 01100101` |

### Reference Variable

![Screenshot2026 01 28at7 30 26PM](/images/Screenshot2026-01-28at7.30.26PM.png)

This variable allows you to refer to the result of the text decoding in future action blocks down your endpoint's flow. This variable must be assigned a custom name.

<Tip>
  Make your reference variable names as descriptive and unique as possible to prevent your endpoint flow from becoming cluttered. If a future variable is assigned the same name, the value of your reference variable will be overriden.
