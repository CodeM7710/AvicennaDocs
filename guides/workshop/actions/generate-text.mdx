---

The **Generate Text** action allows you to use the ChatGPT integration to generate text dynamically during your endpoint’s execution.

This block sends your prompt to the selected AI model and returns the generated output, which can then be stored and reused in later blocks.

---

## ChatGPT Integration

This action requires a connected ChatGPT integration.

If no integration is connected, you will be prompted to connect one before the block can run.

---

## Prompt

The **Prompt** field is the instruction sent to the AI model.

You can:

- Write plain text instructions  
- Include dynamic variables using `{}` syntax  
- Combine static and dynamic values  

### Example

```text
Write a short welcome email for {params.partner}.
```

The AI will receive the fully resolved prompt at runtime.

---

## Model

The **Model** dropdown allows you to choose which AI model will generate the response.

Different models may vary in:

- Speed  
- Cost  
- Output quality  
- Context length  

Choose the model that best fits your use case.

---

## Temperature

The **Temperature** controls how creative or deterministic the output will be.

- `0.0` → Very deterministic and predictable  
- `0.5` → Balanced  
- `1.0` → More creative and varied  

Lower values are ideal for structured or factual outputs.  
Higher values are better for brainstorming or creative writing.

---

## Reference Variable

The **Reference Variable** defines where the generated output will be stored.

Once set, you can reference the AI’s response anywhere later in the flow using:

```
{local.VARIABLE_NAME}
```

### Example

If:

- **Reference Variable:** `summary`

You can later use:

```
{local.summary}
```

---

## Behavior & Scope

- The text is generated at runtime when the block executes.  
- The output is stored only for the current endpoint execution.  
- If another block later uses the same reference variable name, the previous value will be overridden.  

The **Generate Text** block is ideal for creating dynamic emails, summaries, transformations, classifications, and other AI-powered outputs directly inside your API flow.
