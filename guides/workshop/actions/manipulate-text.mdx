### Input Text

The **input text** is the base text value that the manipulative operation will be performed upon. This may be static text or a variable.

### Operation

The **operation** dictates the way your text vaue will be manipulated. Below are listed the available operations that can be applied to a text value using the Manipulate Text action:

| **Operation**      | **Description**                                                                            | **Example Output** |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------- |
| To Uppercase       | Converts text to all capital letters                                                       | HELLO THERE        |
| To Lowercase       | Converts text to all lowercase letters                                                     | hello there        |
| Trim Spaces        | Removed all spaces from the text, including leading/trailing spaces                        | HelloThere         |
| Replace Text       | Replaces all instances of a specific string found in the text with another specific string | Hello Bob          |
| Split by Delimiter | Splits the text into fragments, using a specific character as a boundary marker            | [Hello,There]      |
| Concatenate        | Appends additional text to the existing text value                                         | HelloThere         |

### Reference Variable 

![Screenshot2026 01 27at10 05 03PM](/images/Screenshot2026-01-27at10.05.03PM.png)

This variable allows you to refer to the result of the text manipulation in future action blocks down your endpoint's flow. This variable must be assigned a custom name.

<Tip>
  Make your reference variable names as descriptive and unique as possible to prevent your endpoint flow from becoming cluttered. If a future variable is assigned the same name, the value of your reference variable will be overriden.
