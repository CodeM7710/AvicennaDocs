The **Send Email** block allows you to send transactional or dynamic emails directly within your endpoint’s execution using the Resend integration.

This block sends an email at runtime and can include static content or dynamic variables from earlier in your flow.

## Resend Integration

This action requires a connected **Resend** integration.

If no integration is connected, you will be prompted to connect one before the block can execute.

---

## To

The **To** field defines the recipient of the email.

You can enter:

- A static email address
- A dynamic variable
- A combination of both

### Examples

```text
user@example.com
```

```text
{params.recipient}
```

---

## From

The **From** field defines the sender of the email.

Format:

```text
Your App Name <hello@yourdomain.com>
```

The sending domain must be verified within your Resend account.

---

## Subject

The **Subject** field defines the email’s subject line.

You may include dynamic variables using `{}` syntax.

### Example

```text
Welcome to our platform, {params.name}!
```

---

## Body

The **Body** field contains the content of the email.

You can:

- Write plain text
- Include dynamic variables
- Combine static and dynamic content

### Example

```text
Hi {params.name},

Thank you for signing up.

Best,
The Team
```

All variables are resolved at runtime before the email is sent.

---

## Using Variables

Any previously stored variable can be referenced using:

```
{local.VARIABLE_NAME}
```

Example:

```
{local.summary}
```

---

## Behavior & Scope

- The email is sent immediately when the block executes.
- If the block fails (e.g., invalid email or unverified domain), the flow may stop depending on your error handling setup.
- Dynamic variables are resolved at runtime.

The **Send Email** block is ideal for confirmations, notifications, alerts, and AI-generated messages within your API flows.
