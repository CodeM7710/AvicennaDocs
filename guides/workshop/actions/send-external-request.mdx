### Block Name

The **block name** is the reference name for the request that will correspond to the response variables you can use in future actions.

<Tip>
  If a future block is assigned the same name, the value of your reference variable may be overriden.

| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{BLOCK_NAME.body}`     | Returns full response body                                  |
| `{BLOCK_NAME.status}`   | Returns the request status                                  |
| `{BLOCK_NAME.body.KEY}` | Returns the value of a specific key in a JSON response body |
