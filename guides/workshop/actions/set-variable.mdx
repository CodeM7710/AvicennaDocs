The **Set Variable** action allows you to define a value that can be reused anywhere in your endpoint’s execution. Variables created with this block are scoped to the current execution and can be referenced in any subsequent block.

### Name

The **Name** field defines the identifier of your variable.

This is the key you will use when referencing the value later in the flow. Variable names:

- Must be unique within the same execution scope
- Should not contain spaces
- Are case-sensitive

<Note>
  If another **Set Variable** block uses the same name later in the flow, the previous value will be overridden.
</Note>

### Value

The **Value** field defines what is stored inside the variable.

This can be:

- Static text (e.g. `Hello world`)
- A number (e.g. `42`)
- A boolean (`true` / `false`)
- A dynamic reference (e.g. `{request.body.name}`)
- A computed value from previous blocks or input from a query parameter

The value is stored exactly as defined at the moment this block runs.

## Referencing Variables

To use a variable created by this block, use the following syntax:

```
{local.VARIABLE_NAME}
```

### Example

If you create:

- **Name:** `userId`
- **Value:** `{request.body.id}`

You can reference it later as:

```
{local.userId}
```

## Behavior & Scope

- Variables are available only during the current endpoint execution.
- They do not persist between requests.
- They can be overridden by redefining the same name later in the flow.

The **Set Variable** block helps keep flows clean, readable, and easier to maintain.
