After you complete this guide, you'll have a live API up and running, ready for custom endpoints and integrations!

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    If you haven't already, create an Avicenna account by navigating to the [Sign Up](https://www.avicenna.dev/signup) page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your project">
    After creating an account, you'll be automatically redirected to the [Onboarding](https://www.avicenna.dev/dashboard/onboarding) page.

    Follow the prompts to give your project a name. Your project's name will be used only as an internal reference label for your team and will not affect your API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose an API subdomain">
    After naming your project, you may choose a custom subdomain for your API to be hosted on. For example, if you choose the subdomain `compass`, your API will be immediately hosted at `https://compass.avicenna.dev/api`.

    <Warning>
      Once you've chosen an API subdomain, changing it could cause breaking changes for your users and make previous URLs become outdated.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build your first endpoint">
    After completing the Onboarding prompts, navigate to the main [Dashboard](https://www.avicenna.dev/dashboard) and click the **Create Endpoint**  button in the sidebar. Name your endpoint and a new Workshop will open.

    Time to start building! Refer to the Workshop section in the sidebar of this documentation for more help building endpoints.
