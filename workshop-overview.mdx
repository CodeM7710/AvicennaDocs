## Action Pool

The left sidebar of the Workshop contains a pool of all the available actions. Drag and drop an action block from the sidebar into the main workflow area to add it to your endpoint's flow.

Actions are divided into different organized categories. In addition, you can search through actions using the search bar.

## Workflow Area

The main workflow area in the center of the Workshop is where all of your blocks can be connected to form logic trees that will be executed in order when a request is sent to the endpoint.

### Building Logic Trees

Start building your logic tree by dragging an action from the Action Pool sidebar and dropping it into the Workflow Area. You can then connect it to other blocks by dragging out from its connection nodes and dropping the connection onto another block's connection nodes.

### Action Bar

The top navbar in the Workshop contains quick links to return to the main Dashboard, view your endpoint's deployment status, or save/deploy the endpoint.

To view additional information about your endpoint's deployment status, click on the **Live** tag next to the endpoint path. The endpoint's full live URL will also be shown there.

In addition to the Save and Deploy buttons in the Action Bar, you can use the quick keyboard shortcuts **⌘S** and **⌘D** respectively.

### Base Settings Block

The base green block at the start of the logic tree contains basic settings for the endpoint, including the <Tooltip tip="Every endpoint has a different slug that will be used in its URL to request it specifically in the format: https://SUBDOMAIN.avicenna.dev/api/SLUG" headline="Endpoint Slug">endpoint slug</Tooltip> and [query parameters](/query-parameters). These can be edited directly from the Action Configuration sidebar when the Base Settings block is selected.
